### `VaatiYT Textures`
These are the 'modernized' ice cream textures created for me by MCreator user '42506' back in late 2019. This can be unzipped with **WinRAR** or **7z**.
### `VICM-BETA Changelog Full.txt`
The full MICM beta changelog (back when it was still referred to as ICM/VICM), made around the time I released Beta 1.5. It is identical to what I wrote for the actual changelogs, just compiled in one text file. It can be opened with pretty much any text editor.
